# Contributing

Data Lasso is still in early stages of development. Because of that, there
is a lot of room for improvement and active development, meaning that some
breaking or large scale changes can potentially be introduced.

All bug fixes and feature improvements are welcome, but if you require more
significant changes to the core of the product, and a module system set up
in place does not cover it, you should contact core contributor, so that
your considerations can be met.
